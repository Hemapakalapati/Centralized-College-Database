Centralized College Database

Abstract of the Project:

There are many academic departments in a college, such as the Department of English, Department of Mathematics, Department of History, and many more. And a variety of courses are offered by each department. And possibly an instructor can teach more than one course. For example, a physics professor can teach maths also.

As a maths student, a student can enroll in both courses. Therefore, there can be any number of students in a course in a college, but the important thing is that there can be only one instructor for both these courses to avoid overlapping. .
